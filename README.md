**Applications use Cloudant Sync to store, index and query local JSON data on a
device and to synchronise data between many devices. Synchronisation is under
the control of the application, rather than being controlled by the underlying
system. Conflicts are also easy to manage and resolve, either on the local
device or in the remote database.**

Cloudant Sync is an [Apache CouchDB&trade;][acdb]
replication-protocol-compatible datastore for
devices that don't want or need to run a full CouchDB instance. It's built
by [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com), building on the work of many others, and
is available under the [Apache 2.0 licence][ap2].

[ap2]: https://github.com/cloudant/sync-android/blob/master/LICENSE
[acdb]: http://couchdb.apache.org/

The API is quite different from CouchDB's; we retain the
[MVCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control) data
model but not the HTTP-centric API.

This library is for iOS, an [Android version][android] is also available.

## Using in your project

CDTDatastore is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "CDTDatastore"
```
Note: We only support building on the latest stable release of Xcode

[gs]: https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore/wiki/Getting-Started

### Using in a Swift app

CDTDatastore is useable from Swift out of the box with a few small quirks. Install as per the
instructions above, and import CloudantSync.h into your [bridging header](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/MixandMatch.html).

The [Overview](#overview) section below has examples in both Objective-C and Swift.

## Example project

There is an example project in the `Project` folder, for iOS 7. To get
this up and running independently of the main codebase, a Podfile is
included:

```bash
$ cd Project
$ pod install
$ open Project.xcworkspace
```

## Running the tests

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Tested Platforms

CDTDatastore gets regularly tested on the following platforms:

- OS X 10.11 (El Captain)
- iPhone 4S (Simulator), iOS 9.2

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview of the library

Once the libraries are added to a project, the basics of adding and reading
a document are:

```objc
#import <CloudantSync.h>

// Create a CDTDatastoreManager using application internal storage path
NSError *outError = nil;
NSFileManager *fileManager= [NSFileManager defaultManager];

NSURL *documentsDir = [[fileManager URLsForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory
                                           inDomains:NSUserDomainMask] lastObject];
NSURL *storeURL = [documentsDir URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"cloudant-sync-datastore"];
NSString *path = [storeURL path];

CDTDatastoreManager *manager =
[[CDTDatastoreManager alloc] initWithDirectory:path
                                         error:&outError];

CDTDatastore *datastore = [manager datastoreNamed:@"my_datastore"
                                            error:&outError];

// Create a document
CDTDocumentRevision *rev = [CDTDocumentRevision revisionWithDocId:@"doc1"];
// Use [CDTDocumentRevision revision] to get an ID generated for you on saving
rev.body = [@{
    @"description": @"Buy milk",
    @"completed": @NO,
    @"type": @"com.cloudant.sync.example.task"
} mutableCopy];

// Add an attachment -- binary data like a JPEG
CDTUnsavedFileAttachment *att1 = [[CDTUnsavedFileAttachment alloc]
                          initWithPath:@"/path/to/image.jpg"
                          name:@"cute_cat.jpg"
                          type:@"image/jpeg"];
rev.attachments[att1.name] = att;

// Save the document to the database
CDTDocumentRevision *revision = [datastore createDocumentFromRevision:rev
                                                                error:&error];
// `revision` will be `nil` on failures.

// Read a document
NSString *docId = revision.docId;
CDTDocumentRevision *retrieved = [datastore getDocumentWithId:docId
                                                        error:&error];
```
If you are using Swift, install the library as per the instructions above
and add the `use_frameworks!` instruction to your target. A bridging header is
required if the `use_frameworks!` instruction is not used.

If you are using a bridging header, include the `CloudantSync.h` and you
should be good to go:

```objc
#import <CDTDatastore/CloudantSync.h>
```


To add, and read documents in Swift, the basics are:

```swift
import CDTDatastore

do {
    let fileManager = FileManager.default

    let documentsDir = fileManager.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask).last!

    let storeURL = documentsDir.appendingPathComponent("cloudant-sync-datastore")
    let path = storeURL.path

    let manager = try CDTDatastoreManager(directory: path)
    let datastore = try manager.datastoreNamed("my_datastore")

    // Create a document
    let rev = CDTDocumentRevision(docId: "doc1")
    rev.body = ["description":"Buy Milk",
                "completed": false,
                "type":"com.cloudant.sync.example.task"]

    // Add an attachment - binary data like a JPEG
    let att1 = CDTUnsavedFileAttachment(path: "/path/to/image/jpg",
                                        name: "cute_cat.jpg",
                                        type: "image/jpeg")!
    rev.attachments[att1.name] = att1

    let revision = try datastore.createDocument(from: rev)

    // Read a document
    let docId = revision.docId
    let retrieved = try datastore.getDocumentWithId(docId!)

} catch {
    print("Encountered an error: \(error)")
}

```

Read more in [the CRUD document](https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore/blob/master/doc/crud.md).

You can subscribe for notifications of changes in the database, which
is described in
[the events documentation](https://github.com/cloudant/cdtdatastore/blob/master/doc/events.md).
It's still a bit raw right now:

- You receive a notification for all new revisions in replication (which can be more
  than one per updated document).

### Replicating Data Between Many Devices

Replication is used to synchronise data between the local datastore and a
remote database, either a CouchDB instance or a Cloudant database. Many
datastores can replicate with the same remote database, meaning that
cross-device synchronisation is achieved by setting up replications from each
device to the remote database.

Replication is simple to get started in the common cases:

```objc
#import <CloudantSync.h>

// Create and start the replicator -- -start is essential!
CDTReplicatorFactory *replicatorFactory =
[[CDTReplicatorFactory alloc] initWithDatastoreManager:manager];

NSString *s = @"https://apikey:apipassword@username.cloudant.com/my_database";
NSURL *remoteDatabaseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:s];
CDTDatastore *datastore = [manager datastoreNamed:@"my_datastore"];

// Replicate from the local to remote database
CDTPushReplication *pushReplication = [CDTPushReplication replicationWithSource:datastore
                                                                         target:remoteDatabaseURL];
NSError *error;
CDTReplicator *replicator = [replicatorFactory oneWay:pushReplication error:&error];

//check error

// Start the replicator
[replicator start];
```
```swift
import CDTDatastore
do {

    let datastore = try manager.datastoreNamed("my_datastore");

    // Replicate from the local to remote database
    let remote = URL(string: "https://apikey:apipassword@username.cloudant.com/my_database")!
    datastore.push(to: remote) { error in

        if let error = error {
            print("Encountered an error: \(error)")
        } else {
            print("Replication complete")
        }

    }

} catch {
    print("Encountered an error: \(error)")
}
```

including how to use IAM authentication instead of username/password.

### Finding data

Once you have thousands of documents in a database, it's important to have
efficient ways of finding them. We've added an easy-to-use querying API. Once
the appropriate indexes are set up, querying is as follows:

```objc
NSDictionary *query = @{
    @"name": @"John",         // name equals John
    @"age": @{ @"$gt" : @25}  // age greater than 25
};
CDTQResultSet *result = [datastore find:query];
[result enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:^(CDTDocumentRevision *rev, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {
    // do something
}];
```

```swift
let query = [
    "name" : "John", // name equals John
    "age" : ["$gt" : 25] // age greater than 25
]
let result = datastore.find(query)
result?.enumerateObjects { rev, idx, stop in
    // do something
}
```

See [Index and Querying Data](https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore/blob/master/doc/query.md).

As of version 0.16.0 the indexing and querying code has been re-written and
has more features than the previous implementation.  For details about
migrating to a 0.16.0+ indexing and query version from a previous version
see [Index and Querying Migration](https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore/blob/master/doc/query-migration.md).

### Conflicts

An obvious repercussion of being able to replicate documents about the place
is that sometimes you might edit them in more than one place at the same time.
When the databases containing these concurrent edits replicate, there needs
to be some way to bring these divergent documents back together. Cloudant's
MVCC data-model is used to do this.

A document is really a tree of the document and its history. This is neat
because it allows us to store multiple versions of a document. In the main,
there's a single, linear tree -- just a single branch -- running from the
creation of the document to the current revision. It's possible, however,
to create further branches in the tree. At this point your document is
conflicted and needs some surgery to resolve the conflicts and bring it
back to full health.

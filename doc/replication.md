# Replicating Data Between Many Devices

Replication is used to synchronise data between the local datastore and a
remote database, either a CouchDB instance or a Cloudant database. Many
datastores can replicate with the same remote database, meaning that
cross-device syncronisation is acheived by setting up replications from each
device to the remote database.

## Replication Scenarios

Replication is a flexible system for copying data between local and remote
databases. Each replication is in a single direction, copying differences either
from a local database to a remote database or a remote database to a local
database.

Often, a single local and remote database will be kept synchronised with each
other. For example, all a user's notes synchronised between a web application
and a device-based application. To fully synchronise data between two databases,
run a push *and* a pull replication. These can be run concurrently.

Replication is not limited to a single pair of databases. If a user has several
devices, it's simple to set up replications between each device and a central
remote database to synchronise data between devices.

Less commonly but just as tenable, data can be sent from a single local
database to several remote databases:

A final diagram shows how to replicate databases on the local
device with several different remote databases, even if they are on different
servers.

Overall, replication is very flexible and can be set up in many topologies.
In particular, many scenarios might only require a push or a pull replication:

* A data collection application might only need to use a push replication to
  replicate data from the device to a remote database -- there's no need for
  synchronisation and therefore no corresponding pull replication.
* If only a local data cache is required, using only a pull replication will
  keep local data up to date with remote data.

## Setting Up For Sync

Currently, the replication process requires a remote database to exist already.
To avoid exposing credentials for the remote system on each device, we recommend
creating a web service to authenticate users and set up databases for client
devices. This web service needs to:

* Handle sign in/sign up for users.
* Create a new remote database for a new user.
* Grant access to the new database for the new device (e.g., via [API keys][keys]
  on Cloudant or the `_users` database in CouchDB).
* Return the database URL and credentials to the device.

## Replication on the Device

Replications are set up in code on a device. Use `CDTPullReplication` and
`CDTPushReplication` objects to create pre-configured `CDTReplicator` objects
using a `CDTReplicatorFactory`. Then call `-startWithError:` on the `CDTReplicator` object
to start a replication. Each `CDTReplicator` object can be assigned a delegate
to receive messages when replication completes or encounters an error.

***Warning***: When you create a CDTReplicator object, you have the only strong
reference to that object. If you do not maintain that reference, the object
will be deallocated and replication will stop prematurely.

Sending changes from a local database to a remote database:

```objc
#import <CloudantSync.h>

// Create and start the replicator -- -start is essential!
CDTReplicatorFactory *replicatorFactory =
[[CDTReplicatorFactory alloc] initWithDatastoreManager:manager];

// username/password can be Cloudant API keys
NSString *s = @"https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database";
NSURL *remoteDatabaseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:s];
CDTDatastore *datastore = [manager datastoreNamed:@"my_datastore"];

// Create a replicator that replicates changes from the local
// datastore to the remote database.
CDTPushReplication *pushReplication = [CDTPushReplication replicationWithSource:datastore
                                                                         target:remoteDatabaseURL];
NSError *error;
CDTReplicator *replicator = [replicatorFactory oneWay:pushReplication error:&error];

// Check replicator isn't nil, if so check error

// Start the replication
if ([replicator startWithError:&error]){
    //handle error
} else {
    //wait for it to complete
    while (replicator.isActive) {
        [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:1.0f];
        NSLog(@" -> %@", [CDTReplicator stringForReplicatorState:replicator.state]);
    }
}
```

And getting new data from a remote database to a local one:

```objc
#import <CloudantSync.h>

// Create and start the replicator -- start is essential!
CDTReplicatorFactory *replicatorFactory =
[[CDTReplicatorFactory alloc] initWithDatastoreManager:manager];

// username/password can be Cloudant API keys
NSString *s = @"https://username:password@username.cloudant.com/my_database";
NSURL *remoteDatabaseURL = [NSURL URLWithString:s];
CDTDatastore *datastore = [manager datastoreNamed:@"my_datastore"];

// Create a replicator that replicates changes from a remote
// database to the local one.
CDTPullReplication *pullReplication = [CDTPullReplication replicationWithSource:remoteDatabaseURL
                                                                         target:datastore];
NSError *error;
CDTReplicator *replicator = [replicatorFactory oneWay:pullReplication error:&error];

// Check replicator isn't nil, if so check error

// Start the replication
if ([replicator startWithError:&error]){
    //handle error
} else {
    //wait for it to complete
    while (replicator.isActive) {
        [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:1.0f];
        NSLog(@" -> %@", [CDTReplicator stringForReplicatorState:replicator.state]);
    }
}
```

### Using a replication delegate

Once you've created a `CDTReplicator` object, you probably don't want your main
thread to go into the loop shown above, as it'll block your user interface.
Instead, the `CDTReplicator` object can be given a delegate conforming to the
[`CDTReplicatorDelegate`](https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore/blob/master/Classes/common/CDTReplicator/CDTReplicatorDelegate.h) protocol.

This protocol has four methods, all optional:

```objc
/**
* Called when the replicator changes state.
*/
-(void) replicatorDidChangeState:(CDTReplicator*)replicator;

/**
* Called whenever the replicator changes progress
*/
-(void) replicatorDidChangeProgress:(CDTReplicator*)replicator;

/**
* Called when a state transition to COMPLETE or STOPPED is
* completed.
*/
- (void)replicatorDidComplete:(CDTReplicator*)replicator;

/**
* Called when a state transition to ERROR is completed.
*/
- (void)replicatorDidError:(CDTReplicator*)replicator info:(NSError*)info;
```

To use, just assign to the `delegate` property of the replicator object. **Note:**
this is a `weak` property, so the delegate needs to be strongly retained elsewhere,
as otherwise its methods won't be called.

You must keep a strong reference to the CDTReplicator object or it will
be deallocated and your delegate methods will never be called.

```objc
// For this example, self retains the delegate and the CDTReplicator.
self.replicationDelegate = /* alloc/init a sync delegate, or share one */;

CDTPushReplication *pushReplication = [CDTPushReplication replicationWithSource:datastore
                                                                         target:remoteDatabaseURL];
NSError *error;
self.replicator = [replicatorFactory oneWay:pushReplication error:&error];
self.replicator.delegate = self.replicatorDelegate;
[self.replicator startWithError:&error];
```

## Customising HTTP requests made during replication

This can be done with HTTP interceptors. These are documented [here](https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore/blob/master/doc/httpinterceptors.md).

/**
 Use this class to store a CDTEncryptionKeychainData instance in the keychain associated to an
 identifier. To say in another way, it is possible to store multiple CDTEncryptionKeychainData
 instances as long as you use a CDTEncryptionKeychainStorage with a different identifier for each
 one.

 Each CDTEncryptionKeychainData is bound to a specific identifier and all of them are grouped in
 the keychain by service. This means that if you use the same identifier to store other data in the
 keychain it will not conflict with these values.

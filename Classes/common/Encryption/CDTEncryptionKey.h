 Use this class to pass around a DPK (Data Protection Key).

 This class is essentially a wrapper for a NSData instance. However this instance has to have a
 specific size: CDTENCRYPTIONKEY_KEYSIZE bytes. The reason for this is that we rely on SQLCipher to
 encrypt databases and it requires a key of CDTENCRYPTIONKEY_KEYSIZE bytes.

/**
 
 CDTPullReplication objects are used to configure a replication of a
 remote Cloudant/CouchDB datastore to a local CDTDatastore. At minimum, source
 and target must be specified.
 
 Example usage:

    CDTDatastoreManager *manager = [...];
    CDTDatastore *datastore = [...];
    CDTReplicatorFactory *replicatorFactory = [...];
    [replicatorFactory start];

    NSURL *remote = [NSURL URLwithString:@"https://user:password@account.cloudant.com/myremotedb"];
 
    CDTPullReplication* pull = [CDTPullReplication replicationWithSource:remote
                                                                  target:datastore];
 
    NSError *error;
    CDTReplicator *rep = [replicatorFactory oneWay:pull error:&error];
 
    //check for error
    [rep start];

 See the Cloudant/CouchDB documentation on replication and filter functions.
 
 * [http://docs.cloudant.com/guides/replication/replication.html#filtered-replication](http://docs.cloudant.com/guides/replication/replication.html#filtered-replication)
 * [http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/couchapp/ddocs.html#filter-functions](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/couchapp/ddocs.html#filter-functions)

 Filter functions in Cloudant/CouchDB are passed two arguments: a document revision and a 
 request header.
 
    function(doc, request){ ... }
 
 Additional parameters to the filter function may be passed in via the `request.query` object.
 In CloudantSync, these parameters are specified with the [CDTPullReplication filterParams] 
 property.
 
 Consider a design document on the remote server called "_design/users" with a filter function
 called "by_age_range":
 
    function(doc, req){
        var age = doc['user']['age'];
        
        if (age >= req.query.min && age <= req.query.max)
            return true;
        else 
            return false;
    }
 
 Documents in this database have the following key-value structure
    {
        '_id':'foo',
        '_rev': '1-x',
        'user': {
                    'age' : 34
                }
        ...
    }
 
 Modifying the example above, in order to replicate from the remote database to the local
 datastore using this filter, specify:
 
    pull.filter = @"users/by_age_range";
    pull.filterParams = @{@"min":@23, @"max":@43};
 
 before calling:
    
    CDTReplicator *rep = [replicatorFactory oneWay:pull error:&error];
 
 The filter function acts on the document revisions found in the _changes feed, 
 filtering the entries that appear.

 * http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/replication/protocol.html
 * http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/database/changes.html
